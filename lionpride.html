        <h2>About the lion pride</h2>
        <p>

            The lion pride can be as small as 3 or big as 40 animals.  In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together. In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all the lionesses in the pride are relatedâ€”mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters.
