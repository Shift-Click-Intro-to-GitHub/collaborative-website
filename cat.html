        <h1>Cat Food</h1>
        <p>Cats like to eat anything they are not supposed to. This includes
          <ul>
            <li>Mice</li>
            <li>Spiders</li>
            <li>Elastic Bands</li>
            <li>Their owner's finger</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          Commercial cat food is readilly available from most supermarkets, but cats will pick and coose until they finally find a brand they enjoy. Usually this will be the most expensive of course.
