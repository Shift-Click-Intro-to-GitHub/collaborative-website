        <h1>Cat Food</h1>
        <p>Cats like to eat anything they are not supposed to. This includes
          <ul>
            <li>Mice</li>
            <li>Spiders</li>
            <li>Elastic Bands</li>
            <li>Their owner's finger</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          Commercial cat food is readilly available from most supermarkets, but cats will pick and coose until they finally find a brand they enjoy. Usually this will be the most expensive of course.

          <h2>Cat Behaviour</h2>
          <p>
            The behaviour a cat exhibits depends on numerous factors: 
            <ul>
                <li>Their mood</li>
                <li>Their environment</li> 
                <li>Any potential threats present </li>
                <li>Their familiarity with the human(s) and/or other animal(s)</li>
<li>Their health</li>
<li>Their personality</li>
            </ul>
            When domesticated and familiar with the person(s), cats often display friendly and loving behaviour but of course, the way this will be expressed, if it all, depends entirely on the factors listed above. 
            Here are some of the ways cats will display their affection towards their owner: 
            <ul>
                <li>Sitting on their owners lap
                    <li>Sleeping next to their owner, most likely on a sofa or on a bed
                        <li>Lying on their back and exposing their belly: if a cat does this, it shows that they truly love you and/or trust you because a cat's belly is the most vulnerable part of their body so therefore if they do this, it is a key sign that they love/trust you</li>
                    <li>Rubbing/bumping their head against yours</li>
<li>Licking you: this is a motherly/fatherly type behaviour so, if a cat does this then, again, this proves that they truly love you</li>            
            </ul>
            However, there are behaviours you need to be aware of because not every cat will take a liking to you
            <ul>
                <li>Growling</li>
                <li>Hissing</li>
                <li>Arching their back</li>
                <li>Swishing their tail</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
