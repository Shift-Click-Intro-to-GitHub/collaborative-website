        <h1>Cat Food</h1>

        <p>Cats like to eat anything they are not supposed to. This includes
          <ul>
            <li>Mice</li>
            <li>Spiders</li>
            <li>Birds</li>
            <li>Elastic Bands</li>
            <li>Their owner's finger</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Commercial cat food is readily available from most supermarkets, but cats will pick and coose until they finally find a brand they enjoy. Usually this will be the most expensive of course.
          Once your cat has chosen his or her favourite, you should stock up on this. Of course your cat will then refuse to eat it.

        <H1>Sleeping Habits</H1>
        <p>Cats are semi-nocturnal animals.</p> 
        <p>During the day when you want to see and play with them, they will most likely be hiding somewhere asleep. Do not attempt to wake your cat in these circumstances, unless you are bored with having ten fingers.</p>
        <p>Your cat will however wake up and want to play at three O'Clock every morning. It will express its fondness for you by bringing small gifts, such as the head of a mouse it caught earlier, depositing it on your head while you are Sleeping</p>
