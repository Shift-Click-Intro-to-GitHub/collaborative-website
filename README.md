# collaborative-website
This repository is designed to help you contribute towards a collaborative website with your peers, whilst practicing GitHub workflow and code reviews.

## adding pages
Pages for each animal should be added using animal.html (where 'animal' is replaced with the subject animal for that page). 

## use of images
Image files should be added to the /images sub folder on GitHub and linked to your webpage from there. Image files should be uploaded with suitable file names.

## adding your page to index
Completed pages should be added to the index.html as a link in the unordered list under the h3 tag.
