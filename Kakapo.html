<h2>About Kakapo </h2>
<p>
The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), native to South America, is the world's largest rodent, often residing in water-logged areas near rivers and lakes within the Amazon rainforest. These semi-aquatic mammals exhibit highly social behavior, forming close-knit family units that aid in protection against predators. Capybaras are adept swimmers and are frequently found lounging in the water to regulate their body temperature. Their herbivorous diet primarily consists of grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits, reflecting their adaptation to a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Reproductively, capybaras are known for forming monogamous pairs, and females give birth to relatively large litters of precocial offspring. The entire family, including other adults, partici
