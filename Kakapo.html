    <h3>Facts that happen to be fun </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Kakapo while unable to fly are excellent climbers as a means to obtain food. However this ability is not utilised as a survival strategy as they resort to digging borrows for their nests.</li>
        <li>Kakapo share a smiler physiology to owls, making it an interesting case of convergent evolution be between the two animal types.
        </li>
        <li>Kakapo are known on the internet as moss chickens.</li>

            The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), native to South America, is the world's largest rodent, often residing in water-logged areas near rivers and lakes within the Amazon rainforest. These semi-aquatic mammals exhibit highly social behavior, forming close-knit family units that aid in protection against predators. Capybaras are adept swimmers and are frequently found lounging in the water to regulate their body temperature. Their herbivorous diet primarily consists of grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits, reflecting their adaptation to a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Reproductively, capybaras are known for forming monogamous pairs, and females give birth to relatively large litters of precocial offspring. The entire family, including other adults, partici
